Install the required system packages using:

sudo apt-get install \
    libgsl0-dev \
    libboost-all-dev \
    python-dev \
    python-setuptools \
    python-numpy \
    python-scipy \
    python-matplotlib \
    python-lxml \
    ipython \
    mercurial\
    noweb\
    scons\
    wget\
    zsh

This works on Ubuntu Linux or other Debian-based distributions.
Other Linux distributions may use different software manager,
but the package names should be equal or very similar to those
above.

NOTE: if you are using python other than system python, such as 
Enthought Python Distribution, you may need to rebuild the 
boost-python and boost-serialization libraries from source. Since 
the default boost-libraries and your python may have different 
unicode length and raise errors when running the build. 

To build boost-python and boost-serialization libraries:
1. download the source code from boost website
        http://www.boost.org/
2. cd to the directory of the source code: (xx is the version)
        
        tar jxvf boost_1_xx_0.tar.bz2
        cd boost_1_xx_0
        ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=python,serialization
        ./b2
        
3. then install the libraries by
        
        ./b2 install
        
    or modify the enviroment variables by adding following lines
    to .zshrc(or .bashrc..)
        
        export LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/boost_1_xx_0/stage/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
        export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/boost_1_xx_0/stage/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
        export CPATH=/path/to/boost_1_xx_0/:$CPATH
    
    or adding them using any other methods and make sure the
    compiler can find them.

After installing all packages you can try to download and build

1. fetch the source code

        ./01-fetchsources.zsh

2. build all source code

        ./02-buildall.zsh
