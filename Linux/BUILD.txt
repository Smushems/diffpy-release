Install the required system packages using:

System packages required for source build

    apt-get install \
        git libboost-all-dev libgsl0-dev mercurial noweb python-dev \
        python-numpy python-setuptools scons wget zsh noweb

This works on Ubuntu Linux or other Debian-based distributions.
Other Linux distributions may use different software manager,
but the package names should be equal or very similar to those
above.

patchelf is also required and can be downloaded from,
    
    http://hydra.nixos.org/release/patchelf/patchelf-0.7


After installing all packages you can try to download and build
the code with

    ./update.zsh
