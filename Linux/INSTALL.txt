(1) Build
    
    If you are using python comes with Linux distruction, install the 
    required system packages using:

    sudo apt-get install \
        libgsl0-dev \
        libboost-all-dev \
        python-dev \
        python-setuptools \
        python-numpy \
        python-scipy \
        python-matplotlib \
        python-lxml \
        ipython \

    This works on Ubuntu Linux or other Debian-based distributions.
    Other Linux distributions may use different software manager,
    but the package names should be equal or very similar to those
    above.
    
    NOTE: if you are using python other than system python, such as 
    Enthought Python Distribution, you may need to rebuild the 
    boost-python and boost-serialization libraries from source. Since 
    the default boost-libraries and your python may have different 
    unicode length and raise errors when running the build. 
    
    To build boost-python and boost-serialization libraries:
    1. download the source code from boost website
            http://www.boost.org/
    2. cd to the directory of the source code: (xx is the version)
            
            tar jxvf boost_1_xx_0.tar.bz2
            cd boost_1_xx_0
            ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=python,serialization
            ./b2
            
    3. then install the libraries by
            
            ./b2 install
            
        or modify the enviroment variables by adding following lines
        to .zshrc(or .bashrc..)
            
            export LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/boost_1_xx_0/stage/lib:$LIBRARY_PATH
            export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/boost_1_xx_0/stage/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
            export CPATH=/path/to/boost_1_xx_0/:$CPATH
        
        or adding them using any other methods and make sure the
        compiler can find them.

    After installing all packages you can try to download and build
    
    1. fetch the source code
    
            ./01-fetchsources.zsh
    
    2. build all source code
    
            ./02-buildall.zsh

(3) Install

    For a one-user installation determine the Python directory for user
    files, create it if it does not exist yet, and add there a symbolic
    link to the diffpy-1.0.pth file:

    D="$(python -c 'import site; print site.USER_SITE')"
    mkdir -p "$D"
    ln -si $PWD/diffpy-1.0.pth "$D"/

    For a system-wide installation create symbolic link in the directory
    for system-wide Python packages:

    sudo ln -si $PWD/diffpy-1.0.pth /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

    Note it is essential to use the symbolic link.  Making a copy of the
    pth file would not work.


(3) Test the installation with

    ./runtests.sh
