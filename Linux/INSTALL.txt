(1) Install the required system packages using:

    sudo apt-get install \
        libgsl0-dev \
        libboost-all-dev \
        python-dev \
        python-setuptools \
        python-numpy \
        python-scipy \
        python-matplotlib \
        python-lxml \
        ipython \

    This works on Ubuntu Linux or other Debian-based distributions.
    Other Linux distributions may use different software manager,
    but the package names should be equal or very similar to those
    above.


(2) For a one-user installation determine the Python directory for user
    files, create it if it does not exist yet, and add there a symbolic
    link to the diffpy-1.0.pth file:

    D="$(python -c 'import site; print site.USER_SITE')"
    mkdir -p "$D"
    ln -si $PWD/diffpy-1.0.pth "$D"/

    For a system-wide installation create symbolic link in the directory
    for system-wide Python packages:

    sudo ln -si $PWD/diffpy-1.0.pth /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

    Note it is essential to use the symbolic link.  Making a copy of the
    pth file would not work.


(3) Test the installation with

    ./runtests.sh
